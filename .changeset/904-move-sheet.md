On iPhone, Folders in the reader opens a glass Move to… sheet for IMAP and Microsoft mail (#904). The sheet names the connection's provider and address, narrows its folders with a search field, and lists one row per folder. The message's current folder is checked and cannot be chosen again. Choosing a folder moves the message and closes the sheet. Gmail keeps its Labels panel, and iPad and Mac keep their folder panels.

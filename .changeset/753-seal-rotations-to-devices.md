Removing a Trusted Device now seals the new key epoch separately to each remaining Trusted Device's own encryption key and to a replacement Recovery Key. Nothing the removed device held opens it, not its keys, earlier rings, enrollment secrets or earlier Recovery Keys. Each device binds a long-lived encryption key when it creates the account's keys, confirms admission or first unlocks with the Recovery Key. A bound key is never replaced, and a device that loses its key enrolls again as a new device.

On iPhone, iPad and Mac, **Remove** now shows the replacement Recovery Key first and asks for its last four characters. Cancelling changes nothing. Confirming removes the device, activates the new epoch and makes the replacement Recovery Key current, all at once, after a recent sign-in. If the account changed meanwhile, a fresh key is shown to save and confirm again. A lost reply keeps the proposal on screen, and confirming again never removes twice.

Remaining devices no longer have to adopt a removal before it completes. A device that was offline adopts the newest keys directly when it reconnects, without the Recovery Key. Writes sealed at an earlier epoch are refused and sealed again after adopting the new one. The previous Recovery Key stops admitting devices as soon as a removal activates.

Reply, Reply All and Forward from the Gmail reader on iPhone, iPad and Mac (#613).

- **Sender:** a response starts a Draft from the mailbox that received the message, and only while that mailbox can send. Choosing another sender keeps the reply's threading headers but not the receiving mailbox's Gmail thread, which returns when the receiving mailbox is chosen again. The thread stays scoped to that mailbox during a concurrent sender edit, including the first save.
- **Recipients:** Reply goes to Reply-To or From, or to the original recipients of a message the mailbox sent. Reply All adds the other To and Cc recipients once each, without known Gmail identities belonging to the account unless addressed to the sender alone. Groups and commented headers keep their valid members, and invalid entries are left out.
- **Threading:** replies keep `Re:` subjects, the Gmail thread, In-Reply-To and up to 20 References, including single-parent ancestry when References is absent. Forwards keep `Fwd:` subjects. Opened bodies now keep their addressing and threading headers.
- **Quoted text:** the answered message's readable text stays apart from the authored body, read-only behind Show quoted text.
- **Forwarded files:** Forward downloads every attachment and copies it, with resolved inline images in their original positions and repeated occurrences, into Draft Assets. Files that cannot be copied stay unsendable. Closing the initiating reader, changing accounts or choosing another destination during preparation prevents creation; queued presses start one response.
